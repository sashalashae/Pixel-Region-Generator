# Pixel Region Generator
By Sasha Morgan
Class: ECE 2574

## Project Description:

This program implements a templated Dynamic Array List and Linked List, which are used to make the region grower algorithm. 

Region growing is a simple region-based image segmentation method. It is also classified as a pixel-based image segmentation method since it involves the selection of initial seed points.

This approach to segmentation examines neighboring pixels of initial seed points and determines whether the pixel neighbors should be added to the region. The process is iterated on, in the same manner as general data clustering algorithms.

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:
